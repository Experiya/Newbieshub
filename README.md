Project Title: Newbieshub (A beginner-friendly freelancing Platform)
CATEGORY: Web Application
PURPOSE
The purpose of developing this “Beginner-friendly platform” is to help skilled individuals to earn money by working on a per-project basis. (E.g. students or individuals good with web development or graphic designing can earn money by providing their skills as the service.)
SCOPE
It will provide freelancers access to the clients through a platform we are building. Clients can connect with them and hire the freelancer of their choice, based on their requirements and budget. All communication will be through our platform only.
INTRODUCTION
The introduction contains the following subcategories
Existing System
The present system is also about earning money by completing projects. But they have the following disadvantages:
✔ They are over-saturated.
✔ They are not beginner-friendly.
✔ Scammers all around
✔ Commissions taken are high.
✔ Very slow customer support.
✔ Experienced freelancers winning all projects.
✔ They suspend freelancers without notifying them what went wrong.
Proposed System
The proposed system will have the beginner friendliness that freelancers are looking for, with three levels of segregation. Following are the features:
• Freelancer Registration: Any freelancer can register in the platform, in the specific skill category.
• Capability Test: Every new freelancer has to give a test to ensure whether they have some knowledge about the skill or not, so as to be able to complete beginner-level projects.
• Levels of Freelancing: There will be 3 levels, beginner, intermediate and advanced.
o Beginner Level: Any freelancer that joins the platform after clearing the test goes into this level. Here they work for low priced projects and once they get 20 five star reviews, they get upgraded to Intermediate level.
o Intermediate Level: Freelancers here work for higher-level projects. After gaining 100 five star reviews, they get upgraded to the advanced level.
o Advance Level: Freelancers here are experts in their fields. They get the highest-paid projects.
• Dispute Handling: If a freelancer doesn’t get money for his/her project, they can file a dispute and we will release the money to them. The same goes for clients, if they didn’t get work from freelancers, they can file a dispute, and we will refund their money.
• Scammer Protection: Freelancers not providing quality work or abusing clients will get banned from the platform. Clients not offering projects to anybody will get flagged after 3 chances.
• Bidding System: The client can post projects and freelancers can bid on those projects. The client has full liberty to talk and choose the best freelancer out of them, that suits their needs.
• Suspension: If a freelancer tried to use their personal contact details, then they’ll get a warning. If they again did it, they’ll get a suspension. The proper reason will be given as to what they did wrong.
• Revenue System: Freelancers will earn money through completing projects, and we will earn money by taking 5% commission from beginners, 10% from intermediate, and 15% from advanced freelancers.
